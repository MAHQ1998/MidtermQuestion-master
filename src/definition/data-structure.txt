Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans :Data structure provide by the java.util package perform various function, and it's provides a way to store and retrieve
information in a well-defined manner. Therefore, Datastructures help to manage large amount of data efficiently.
Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans : Creation, insertion, Searching, sorting, traversing, merging, appending, updating etc..
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:Compiler Design,Operating System,Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,
    Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Simulation.
what is an Array?
Ans: An Array is used to store a collection of data.
     Array is a container object that holds fixed and sequential collection of elements, number of values of
     a same type or single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: After creation of array it's length is fixed, but Arraylist is variable length collection class.
     In ArrayList we cannot store primitives data type, we can store Objects. But array can contain both Primitive
     and Objects in Java.
what is LinkedList?
Ans: A common data structure made of chain of nodes in which each node contains a value called linked List.
   The head pointer points to the first node, and the last element of the list points to null
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans:
what is queue?
what is stack?
Ans: Stacks are data structure used to model information accessed in a specific order, Stack class in java
  implemented asa LIFO (last in first out) stack. Which what the last item added to the stack is the
   first one to be removed.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: Stacks that First in first out is FIFO and Last in first out is LIFO.

what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
